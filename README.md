# Full-Stack QA Automation Challenge

This project sets up a containerized CMS (System Under Test) and an automated test suite
using Playwright to verify the core blog functionality.

## Tech stack (planned)

- CMS: WordPress (Docker)
- DB: MySQL/MariaDB (Docker)
- Automation: Playwright (TypeScript)
- Infrastructure: Docker & Docker Compose

Work in progress – setup steps and usage instructions will be added as we build the project.
